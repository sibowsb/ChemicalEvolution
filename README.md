# Chemical Evolution

## Writeups
- `demo_and_report.ipynb` is the final report and demo of the code.
- `interim_report.pdf` is the progress report submitted on May 4.

## Codes
- The `chemical_evolution` package includes classes that model the generic chemical evolution process.
- The `nine_species_network` package inludes classes and hard coded equation that are applicable specifically for the 9-species system at hand.

## Other scripts
- `9_species_net.py` is the command line application wrapper. Run `./9_species_net.py --help` for further documentation.
- The `scratch` directory contains my attempts of playing with the tools used and some test cases.
